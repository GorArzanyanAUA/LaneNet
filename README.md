# LaneNet Implementation in PyTorch for Lane Detection

This project implements the LaneNet architecture using PyTorch for road lane line detection on the TuSimple dataset. The work follows and extends existing open-source implementations and research, aiming to reproduce and improve deep learning-based methods for robust lane detection in autonomous driving systems.

## Objective
To build and train a PyTorch-based model capable of detecting lane markings in real road scenarios using the TuSimple dataset, following the LaneNet architecture and related encoder-decoder designs.
